* Symbol Tables
- key-value pairs
- search for the value associated with a given key
- can we devise a symbol table that has logN time for both search and insert?

* Implementation Considerations
+ Generics
+ Duplicate keys
  - each key has only one value
  - if the key exists, replace its value with the new one
+ Null keys
  - keys must not be null
+ Null values
  - no key can be associated with the value ~null~
  - ~get()~ returns ~null~ for keys not in the table
  - we can use ~put()~ to give a key the value ~null~, thus marking it for deletion
+ Deletion
  - /lazy/ deletion: associate keys to be deleted with the value ~null~, and delete at a later time
+ Iteration
  - use Java's ~Iterable~ interface
+ Key equality
  - override ~equals()~

* Ordered Symbol Tables
As keys are ~Comparable~ objects, we can use this to keep the table in order, and thus expand the API (see code).

+ Minimum and maximum
  - The symbol table can operate like ~IndexMinPQ()~
  - Unlike ~IndexMinPQ~, doesn't allow equal keys
  - Ordered symbol tables support a larger API

+ Floor and ceiling
  - floor: find the largest key that is <= to the given key
  - ceiling: find the smallest key that is >= to the given key

+ Rank and selection
  - rank: find the number of keys less than a given key
  - select: find the key with a given rank
  - ~i = rank(select(i))~
  - ~key == select(rank(key))~

+ Range queries
  - How many keys fall within a given range?
  - Which keys fall in a given range?
 
+ Exeptional cases
  - throw an exception or return null

+ Cost model
  - Look at compares in the inner loop
  - In a few cases might also need to count array accesses

* Clients
+ Test client
  - TestClient.java
  - an example of an indexing client (see Section 3.5)

+ Performance client
  - FrequencyCounter.java
  - finds the number of occurrences of each string
  - which word (no shorter than a given length) occurs most frequently?

Can we develop a symbol-table implementation that can handle a huge number of ~get()~ operations, which itself was built with a large number of intermixed ~get()~ and ~put()~ operations?

* Sequential search in an unordered linked list
- ~get()~ : scan through the list and compare keys
- ~put()~ : scan and compare; update value or create new node
- both insert and search need to compare until a search hit/miss
- inserting N distinct keys takes O(N^2/2) compares
- search takes an average of N/2
- too slow for FrequencyCounter
- SequentialSearchST.java

* Binary search in an ordered array
- keeps Comparable keys in order and uses array indexing to enable fast implementation of ~get()~ and other operations
- maintains parallel arrays of keys and values
- TODO ex3.1.12 for an alternative to parallel arrays
- uses array resizing, too slow for large arrays
- despite binary search being fast, cannot use this symbol table for large amounts of data as ~put()~ is slow
- insert uses ~2N array accesses
- BinarySearchST.java
